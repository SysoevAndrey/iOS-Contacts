## Overview
The **Contacts App** is a mobile application designed to help users view and manage contacts on their device. It is created as a learning project to explore iOS development and user interaction with the phone's contact list.

## Purpose and Goals
The primary purpose of the app is to provide a user-friendly interface for viewing and managing contacts on a mobile device. Through this project, the goal is to gain experience in handling permissions, working with contact data, and implementing features like filtering and sorting.

### Key Objectives:
- **Display Contacts List**: After obtaining the necessary permissions, the app displays a list of contacts from the user's phone book.
- **Filter and Sort Contacts**: Users can filter and sort contacts to locate specific entries easily.
- **Delete Contacts**: The app allows users to remove contacts from the list.

## Features
- **Permission Handling**: Requests permission to access the device's contacts.
- **Contacts Display**: Lists all contacts once permission is granted.
